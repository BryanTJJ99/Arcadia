# Arcadia Reclaimed

## About the Project
Associated with bountiful natural splendor and harmony, Arcadia (Greek: Αρκαδία) is a poetic byword for an idyllic vision of unspoiled wilderness, with the vision of pastoralism and harmony with nature.
Our vision is to capture the aesthetic of local biodiversity through digital mediums, through 
combining stylistic elements from the cyberpunk genre and American portraiture.
This React site allows users to view Arcadia's project and mint NFTs of their choice.

## Built with
- Frontend development framework: ReactJS, Javascript
- Building smart contracts: Solidity
- Libraries used: dotenv, axios
- Ropsten TestNet

In line with our mission, we aim to utilise Layer 2 technology, which are solutions to scale an application by processing transactions off the Layer 1 Ethereum Mainnet, while maintaining the same level of decentralisation and security. This would increase transaction speed and reduce gas fees, and as an extension we hope to utilise the Polygon network to create our own currency that serves as an accredited carbon credit.

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:
```
$ cd ../arcadia
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Features to be implemented in future
- Displaying of NFTs on site after minting
- Connect to Polygon network
- Allow users to create account using Metamask and view their NFT collections
- Web game aspect
- Integrate Toucan Bridge (aggregates carbon credits in the Carbon Pool smart contracts) https://toucan.earth/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
